## Introduction

The **Orchestration Architect: Project Management Subsystem** is a comprehensive framework designed to manage tasks efficiently while integrating seamlessly with version control systems and other tools. This subsystem leverages advanced concepts from **category theory**, such as **objects**, **morphisms**, and **functors**, to model tasks and their state transitions. By representing tasks as YAML files, utilizing symlink-based state management, and integrating with RDF/SPARQL, the system is both **composable** and **extensible**.

### Why This Design?

- **Composable**: Each component (tasks, morphisms, functors) is designed to work independently but integrates seamlessly with others, allowing for modular development and easier maintenance.
- **Extendable**: The use of interfaces and abstract concepts allows new features to be added without disrupting existing functionality.
- **Interface-Based Design**: By defining clear interfaces between components, the system ensures that parts can be swapped or upgraded with minimal impact.
- **Category Theory Foundations**: Utilizing category theory provides a solid mathematical foundation, enabling us to model complex interactions in an elegant and consistent manner.
- **Self-Documenting**: The structure and metadata facilitate automatic documentation generation, helping manage complexity and keeping documentation up-to-date.

---

## Conceptual Overview

### Terminology and Definitions

- **Task**: An object in the category, represented as a YAML file.
- **State**: The status of a task (`backlog`, `active`, `completed`).
- **Morphism**: A state transition between tasks.
- **Functor**: A mapping from the category of tasks and morphisms to another category, preserving their structure.
- **Metadata**: Additional information stored within a task file, tracking state changes and relationships.
- **RDF (Resource Description Framework)**: A semantic framework used to represent information and relationships.
- **SPARQL**: A query language for RDF, used to retrieve and manipulate task data.
- **URN (Uniform Resource Name)**: A unique identifier for resources, following the `urn:oa:<resource>` schema.

### Why This Design?

- **Symlink-Based State Management**: Provides a simple yet powerful way to represent task states without duplicating data.
- **YAML Task Representation**: Human-readable and machine-parsable format that allows easy editing and integration.
- **Category Theory Concepts**: Offers a high-level abstraction that simplifies the modeling of complex systems.
- **RDF/SPARQL Integration**: Enables semantic querying and integration with other systems.
- **Self-Documenting System**: Metadata and structured formats facilitate automatic documentation and tracking.

## System Architecture

### Directory Structure

The subsystem is designed to be environment-agnostic and can be integrated into any project directory. The recommended structure is:

```
project/
├── tasks/
│   ├── OA-TASK-001.yaml
│   └── ...
├── backlog/
│   ├── OA-TASK-001.yaml -> ../tasks/OA-TASK-001.yaml
│   └── ...
├── active/
│   └── ...
├── completed/
│   └── ...
├── scripts/
│   ├── tasks (CLI script)
│   └── ...
├── rdf/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

- **Tasks Directory**: Stores YAML files representing each task.
- **State Directories**: `backlog/`, `active/`, `completed/` contain symlinks to tasks, representing their current state.
- **Scripts Directory**: Contains CLI scripts and tools for managing tasks.
- **RDF Directory**: Stores RDF representations of tasks for semantic querying.

### Task Representation

Tasks are stored as YAML files in the `tasks/` directory. Each task file includes:

- **Metadata**: Creator, creation time, state changes.
- **Identifiers**: Unique task IDs.
- **Descriptions**: Summary and detailed descriptions.
- **Relationships**: Linked requirements and tasks.

**Example Task YAML (`tasks/OA-TASK-001.yaml`):**

```yaml
task_id: OA-TASK-001
summary: "Design the project management subsystem"
status: "backlog"
priority: "high"
requirements:
  - urn:oa:requirement:REQ-001
linked_tasks:
  - urn:oa:task:OA-TASK-002
description: |
  This task involves designing and implementing the project management system for the Orchestration Architect framework.
metadata:
  created_by: "user"
  created_at: "2024-10-02T12:00:00Z"
  state_changes:
    - state: "backlog"
      timestamp: "2024-10-02T12:00:00Z"
  tags:
    - "project-management"
    - "design"
```

### Symlink-Based State Management

Symlinks are used to represent the current state of tasks without duplicating data.

- **No Symlink Loops**: Each symlink points directly to the original file.
- **State Directories**: Symlinks are placed in `backlog/`, `active/`, or `completed/` to represent their state.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Clean and Scalable**: Allows tasks to exist in different states without duplicating data.
  - **Simplifies State Management**: Moving symlinks is a lightweight operation that reflects state changes instantly.

---

## Category-Theoretic Modeling

### Tasks as Objects

In category theory, **objects** represent entities within a category. Here, each task in a particular state is an object:

- **Ob(Category)** = {Tasks in `backlog`, `active`, `completed`}

### Morphisms: State Transitions

**Morphisms** represent state transitions between tasks:

- **Hom(Category)** = {Morphisms between tasks}

#### Examples of Morphisms

1. **Creation Morphism**:
   - *Source*: `null` (no task)
   - *Target*: Task in `backlog`
   - *Function*: `create_task`

2. **State Change Morphisms**:
   - *Backlog to Active*: Task starts (`start_task`)
   - *Active to Completed*: Task completes (`complete_task`)
   - *Active to Backlog*: Task is paused (`pause_task`)

3. **Deletion Morphism**:
   - *Source*: Task in any state
   - *Target*: `null` (task removed)
   - *Function*: `delete_task`

### Functors: Mapping to External Systems

**Functors** map our task category to other categories (e.g., RDF representations, external APIs) while preserving the structure of objects and morphisms.

#### Examples of Functors

1. **Symlink Functor**:
   - Maps task state transitions to symlink operations in the file system.
   - **Why**: Provides a direct representation of the task's state in the filesystem, simplifying state management.

2. **RDF Functor**:
   - Maps tasks and state changes to RDF triples, enabling semantic querying.
   - **Why**: Allows integration with semantic web technologies and advanced querying capabilities.

3. **API Functor**:
   - Maps task operations to API endpoints.
   - **Why**: Facilitates integration with external systems and services, enhancing interoperability.

### Commutative Diagrams

Commutative diagrams illustrate how different paths of morphisms lead to the same result, ensuring consistency.

**Diagram Example**:

```
           create_task            start_task             complete_task
null ---------------> backlog -----------> active ----------------> completed
 \                    |                   |                         |
  \                   |                   |                         |
   \______ RDF _______|________ RDF ______|__________ RDF __________|
```

- **Horizontal Arrows**: Morphisms (state transitions).
- **Vertical Arrows**: Functor mappings to RDF representations.
- **Commutativity**: Performing state transitions and then mapping to RDF is the same as first mapping to RDF and then performing the corresponding RDF updates.

---

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Git**: For version control (optional but recommended).
- **Python 3**: For scripts and RDF generation.
- **Bash**: For CLI scripting.
- **RDF Tools**: Such as Apache Jena for advanced RDF handling.

### Phase 1: Environment Setup

**Objective**: Establish the directory structure and initialize the system.

#### Steps

1. **Create Project Directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p project/{tasks,backlog,active,completed,scripts,rdf}
   ```

2. **Initialize Git Repository (Optional)**

   ```bash
   cd project
   git init
   ```

   - **Why**: Using Git allows tracking changes, facilitating collaboration, and integrating commits with task management.

### Phase 2: Task Creation and Representation

**Objective**: Implement task creation and initial representation.

#### Task Creation Script (`scripts/tasks`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

TASK_DIR="tasks"

generate_task_id() {
    last_id=$(ls $TASK_DIR | grep -Eo 'OA-TASK-[0-9]+' | sort | tail -n 1 | grep -Eo '[0-9]+$')
    next_id=$((last_id + 1))
    printf "OA-TASK-%03d" $next_id
}

create_task() {
    task_id=$(generate_task_id)
    task_file="$TASK_DIR/$task_id.yaml"
    cat > "$task_file" <<EOF
task_id: $task_id
summary: "$1"
status: "backlog"
priority: "$2"
requirements: []
linked_tasks: []
description: ""
metadata:
  created_by: "$(whoami)"
  created_at: "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")"
  state_changes:
    - state: "backlog"
      timestamp: "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")"
EOF
    ln -s "../$task_file" "backlog/$task_id.yaml"
    echo "Task $task_id created."
}

# Command parsing
if [ "$1" == "create" ]; then
    create_task "$2" "$3"
else
    echo "Usage: ./tasks create \"Task Summary\" \"Priority\""
fi
```

- **Why**:
  - **Composable**: Functions like `generate_task_id` and `create_task` can be reused or extended.
  - **Self-Documenting**: The script's structure and comments make it easier to understand and maintain.

### Phase 3: State Transitions and Morphisms

**Objective**: Implement state transitions as morphisms.

#### State Transition Function (`change_task_state`)

```bash
change_task_state() {
    task_id="$1"
    new_state="$2"
    task_file="tasks/$task_id.yaml"

    # Find current state
    current_state=$(find . -type l -name "$task_id.yaml" | xargs dirname | xargs basename)

    # Remove symlink from current state
    rm "$current_state/$task_id.yaml"

    # Add symlink to new state
    ln -s "../$task_file" "$new_state/$task_id.yaml"

    # Update status in task file
    sed -i "s/^status: .*/status: \"$new_state\"/" "$task_file"

    # Append state change to metadata
    sed -i "/state_changes:/a \  - state: \"$new_state\"\n    timestamp: \"$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")\"" "$task_file"
}

# Usage example:
# change_task_state OA-TASK-001 active
```

- **Why**:
  - **Composable**: The function can be used for any state transition.
  - **Interface-Based**: Defines a clear interface (`task_id`, `new_state`) for changing task states.

### Phase 4: Functors and System Integration

**Objective**: Map morphisms to external systems using functors.

#### Define Functors

```bash
functor_symlink_update() {
    # Already handled in change_task_state
    :
}

functor_rdf_update() {
    task_id="$1"
    ./generate_rdf.sh "$task_id"
}

functor_api_update() {
    # Placeholder for API update logic
    :
}
```

#### Invoke Functors After State Changes

```bash
change_task_state() {
    # Existing state change logic
    # ...

    # Invoke functors
    functor_symlink_update
    functor_rdf_update "$task_id"
    functor_api_update "$task_id"
}
```

- **Why**:
  - **Extendable**: New functors can be added without modifying existing code.
  - **Composable**: Functors can be composed to perform complex mappings.

### Phase 5: Command-Line Interface (CLI) Development

**Objective**: Develop a user-friendly CLI with fuzzy matching and flexible commands.

#### Extend `tasks` Script with Commands

```bash
case "$1" in
    create)
        create_task "$2" "$3"
        ;;
    start|stop|complete)
        task_id=$(fuzzy_match_task_id "$2")
        case "$1" in
            start)
                change_task_state "$task_id" "active"
                ;;
            stop)
                change_task_state "$task_id" "backlog"
                ;;
            complete)
                change_task_state "$task_id" "completed"
                ;;
        esac
        ;;
    list)
        list_tasks "$2"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid command."
        ;;
esac
```

#### Implement Fuzzy Matching

```bash
fuzzy_match_task_id() {
    input="$1"
    match=$(ls tasks | grep -E "OA-TASK-.*$input.*" | head -n 1)
    echo "${match%.yaml}"
}
```

- **Why**:
  - **User-Friendly**: Fuzzy matching simplifies task selection.
  - **Composable**: Functions like `fuzzy_match_task_id` can be reused elsewhere.

### Phase 6: RDF/SPARQL Integration

**Objective**: Represent tasks semantically using RDF and enable querying with SPARQL.

#### Generate RDF Representation

```bash
./generate_rdf.sh "$task_id"
```

#### `generate_rdf.py` Script

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import yaml
import sys
from rdflib import Graph, Namespace, URIRef, Literal
from rdflib.namespace import RDF

task_file = sys.argv[1]
with open(task_file, 'r') as f:
    data = yaml.safe_load(f)

g = Graph()
OA = Namespace("urn:oa:")

task_uri = OA['task/' + data['task_id']]
g.add((task_uri, RDF.type, OA.Task))
g.add((task_uri, OA.summary, Literal(data['summary'])))
g.add((task_uri, OA.status, Literal(data['status'])))
g.add((task_uri, OA.priority, Literal(data['priority'])))

for req in data.get('requirements', []):
    g.add((task_uri, OA.requires, URIRef(req)))
for linked_task in data.get('linked_tasks', []):
    g.add((task_uri, OA.linkedTask, URIRef(linked_task)))

g.add((task_uri, OA.description, Literal(data['description'])))
g.add((task_uri, OA.createdBy, Literal(data['metadata']['created_by'])))
g.add((task_uri, OA.createdAt, Literal(data['metadata']['created_at'])))

for state_change in data['metadata']['state_changes']:
    state_node = URIRef(f"{task_uri}/stateChange/{state_change['timestamp']}")
    g.add((task_uri, OA.stateChange, state_node))
    g.add((state_node, OA.state, Literal(state_change['state'])))
    g.add((state_node, OA.timestamp, Literal(state_change['timestamp'])))

g.serialize(destination=f"rdf/{data['task_id']}.ttl", format='turtle')
```

- **Why**:
  - **Interface-Based Design**: The script defines clear interfaces for data input and output.
  - **Extendable**: Additional properties can be added without affecting existing functionality.

### Phase 7: API and OpenAPI Schema Generation

**Objective**: Define an API for the subsystem and generate an OpenAPI schema for integration.

#### Define API Endpoints

- **`GET /tasks`**: List all tasks.
- **`POST /tasks`**: Create a new task.
- **`GET /tasks/{task_id}`**: Retrieve task details.
- **`PUT /tasks/{task_id}`**: Update a task.
- **`DELETE /tasks/{task_id}`**: Delete a task.

#### OpenAPI Schema (Excerpt)

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Orchestration Architect Task API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /tasks:
    get:
      summary: List all tasks
      responses:

        status:
          type: string
        priority:
          type: string
        requirements:

        description:
          type: string
        metadata:
          type: object
```

- **Why**:
  - **Extendable**: New endpoints can be added as needed.
  - **Interface-Based**: Defines a clear contract for external integrations.

  - `collection`: Collections (e.g., `urn:oa:collection:orchestration_architect.containers`)

### Appendix B: RDF Schema Definitions

Define RDF classes and properties for tasks.

**Classes**:

- `oa:Task`

**Properties**:

- `oa:summary`
- `oa:status`
- `oa:priority`
- `oa:requires`
- `oa:linkedTask`
- `oa:description`
- `oa:createdBy`
- `oa:createdAt`
- `oa:stateChange`
- `oa:timestamp`
- `oa:state`

### Appendix C: OpenAPI Specification

Refer to the OpenAPI schema in the implementation guide for API definitions. This can be expanded to include additional endpoints and detailed parameter descriptions.

   - [ ] YAML structure defined.
   - **Goal**: Enable easy creation and representation of tasks.

3. **State Transitions and Morphisms**
   - [ ] State transition functions implemented.
   - [ ] Morphisms modeled correctly.
   - **Goal**: Accurately represent state changes and manage task states.

4. **Functors and System Integration**
   - [ ] Functors defined and invoked after state changes.
   - [ ] Integration with external systems established.
   - **Goal**: Ensure changes are reflected across all systems.

5. **CLI Development**
   - [ ] User-friendly CLI developed.
   - [ ] Fuzzy matching and flexible commands implemented.
   - **Goal**: Simplify task management and improve user experience.

6. **RDF/SPARQL Integration**
   - [ ] RDF generation scripts implemented.
   - [ ] SPARQL queries tested.
   - **Goal**: Enable semantic querying and integration.

7. **API Development**
   - [ ] API endpoints defined.
   - [ ] OpenAPI schema generated.
   - **Goal**: Facilitate external integrations and interoperability.

8. **Documentation and Self-Documentation**
   - [ ] README updated with detailed explanations.
   - [ ] Scripts and code commented thoroughly.
   - **Goal**: Create a self-documenting system that manages complexity.

By checking off each item, you can track progress and ensure that the subsystem meets its goals at every stage.
