## Introduction

The **Orchestration Architect: Project Management Subsystem** is a comprehensive framework designed to manage tasks efficiently while integrating seamlessly with other tools and services. This subsystem leverages advanced concepts from **category theory**, such as **objects**, **morphisms**, and **functors**, to model tasks and their state transitions. By representing tasks as YAML files, utilizing symlink-based state management, and integrating with RDF/SPARQL, the system is both **composable** and **extensible**.

### Why This Design?

- **Composable**: Each component (tasks, morphisms, functors) works independently but integrates seamlessly, allowing modular development and easier maintenance.
- **Extensible**: The use of interfaces and abstract concepts allows new features to be added without disrupting existing functionality.
- **Interface-Based Design**: Clear interfaces between components ensure that parts can be swapped or upgraded with minimal impact.
- **Category Theory Foundations**: Provides a solid mathematical foundation, enabling us to model complex interactions elegantly and consistently.
- **Self-Documenting**: The structure and metadata facilitate automatic documentation generation, helping manage complexity and keeping documentation up-to-date.

---

## Conceptual Overview

### Terminology and Definitions

- **Task**: An object in the category, represented as a YAML file.
- **State**: The status of a task (`backlog`, `active`, `completed`).
- **Morphism**: A state transition between tasks.
- **Functor**: A mapping from the category of tasks and morphisms to another category, preserving their structure.
- **Metadata**: Additional information stored within a task file, tracking state changes and relationships.
- **RDF (Resource Description Framework)**: A semantic framework used to represent information and relationships.
- **SPARQL**: A query language for RDF, used to retrieve and manipulate task data.
- **URN (Uniform Resource Name)**: A unique identifier for resources, using prefixes like `oa:task:OA_TASK-001`.

### Why This Design?

- **Symlink-Based State Management**: Provides a simple yet powerful way to represent task states without duplicating data.
- **YAML Task Representation**: Human-readable and machine-parsable format that allows easy editing and integration.
- **Category Theory Concepts**: Offers a high-level abstraction that simplifies the modeling of complex systems.
- **RDF/SPARQL Integration**: Enables semantic querying and integration with other systems.
- **Self-Documenting System**: Metadata and structured formats facilitate automatic documentation and tracking.

## System Architecture

### Directory Structure

The subsystem is designed to be environment-agnostic and can be integrated into any project directory. The recommended structure is:

```
project/
├── bin/
│   ├── oa (CLI script)
│   └── ...
├── data/
│   ├── tasks/
│   │   ├── OA_TASK-001.yaml
│   │   └── ...
│   └── rdf/
│       ├── OA_TASK-001.ttl
│       └── ...
├── backlog/
│   ├── OA_TASK-001.yaml -> ../data/tasks/OA_TASK-001.yaml
│   └── ...
├── active/
│   └── ...
├── completed/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

- **`bin/` Directory**: Contains CLI scripts and tools for managing tasks.
- **`data/` Directory**: Stores task YAML files (`data/tasks/`) and RDF representations (`data/rdf/`).
- **State Directories**: `backlog/`, `active/`, `completed/` contain symlinks to tasks, representing their current state.

### Task Representation

Tasks are stored as YAML files in the `data/tasks/` directory. Each task file includes:

- **Metadata**: Creator, creation time, state changes.
- **Identifiers**: Unique task IDs.
- **Descriptions**: Summary and detailed descriptions.
- **Relationships**: Linked requirements and tasks.

**Example Task YAML (`data/tasks/OA_TASK-001.yaml`):**

```yaml
task_id: OA_TASK-001
summary: "Design the project management subsystem"
status: "backlog"
priority: "high"
requirements:
  - oa:requirement:OA_SRS-001
linked_tasks:
  - oa:task:OA_TASK-002
description: |
  This task involves designing and implementing the project management system for the Orchestration Architect framework.
metadata:
  created_by: "user"
  created_at: "2024-10-02T12:00:00Z"
  state_changes:
    - state: "backlog"
      timestamp: "2024-10-02T12:00:00Z"
  tags:
    - "project-management"
    - "design"
```

### Symlink-Based State Management

Symlinks are used to represent the current state of tasks without duplicating data.

- **No Symlink Loops**: Each symlink points directly to the original file.
- **State Directories**: Symlinks are placed in `backlog/`, `active/`, or `completed/` to represent their state.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Clean and Scalable**: Allows tasks to exist in different states without duplicating data.
  - **Simplifies State Management**: Moving symlinks is a lightweight operation that reflects state changes instantly.

---

## Category-Theoretic Modeling

### Tasks as Objects

In category theory, **objects** represent entities within a category. Here, each task in a particular state is an object:

- **Ob(Category)** = {Tasks in `backlog`, `active`, `completed`}

### Morphisms: State Transitions

**Morphisms** represent state transitions between tasks:

- **Hom(Category)** = {Morphisms between tasks}

#### Examples of Morphisms

1. **Creation Morphism**:
   - **Source**: `null` (no task)
   - **Target**: Task in `backlog`
   - **Function**: `create_task`
   - **Preservation**: The morphism preserves the structure by adding a new task object to the category.

2. **State Change Morphisms**:
   - **Backlog to Active**: Task starts (`start_task`)
   - **Active to Completed**: Task completes (`complete_task`)
   - **Active to Backlog**: Task is paused (`pause_task`)
   - **Preservation**: Morphisms map tasks from one state object to another, maintaining the category's structure.

3. **Deletion Morphism**:
   - **Source**: Task in any state
   - **Target**: `null` (task removed)
   - **Function**: `delete_task`
   - **Preservation**: The morphism removes the task object from the category, consistent with the category's rules.

### Functors: Mapping to External Systems

**Functors** map our task category to other categories (e.g., RDF representations, external APIs) while preserving the structure of objects and morphisms.

#### Examples of Functors

1. **Symlink Functor**:
   - **Source Category**: Tasks and their state transitions.
   - **Target Category**: File system symlinks.
   - **Mapping**: Task objects are mapped to symlinks; morphisms are mapped to symlink operations.
   - **Preservation**: State transitions (morphisms) correspond to moving symlinks between state directories.

2. **RDF Functor**:
   - **Source Category**: Tasks and their state transitions.
   - **Target Category**: RDF triples.
   - **Mapping**: Tasks are mapped to RDF resources; state changes are mapped to RDF properties.
   - **Preservation**: The functor ensures that state transitions are reflected in the RDF graph, maintaining consistency.

3. **API Functor**:
   - **Source Category**: Tasks and operations.
   - **Target Category**: API endpoints and responses.
   - **Mapping**: Task operations are mapped to API calls.
   - **Preservation**: The API reflects the task's state and operations accurately.

### Commutative Diagrams

Commutative diagrams illustrate how different paths of morphisms lead to the same result, ensuring consistency.

**Concrete Example**:

Let's consider the creation and activation of a task and how it's represented in both the file system and the RDF graph.

```
          create_task          start_task
    null -------------> backlog -----------> active
       |                   |                   |
       |                   |                   |
       v                   v                   v
    (FS)                 (FS)                (FS)
    Symlink             Symlink             Symlink
     Created            Moved               Moved
       |                   |                   |
       v                   v                   v
    (RDF)                (RDF)               (RDF)
    Triple              Triple              Triple
    Added               Updated             Updated
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **Horizontal Arrows**: Represent morphisms (state transitions).
  - **Vertical Arrows**: Represent functors mapping tasks and morphisms to symlink operations (FS) and RDF updates.
  - **Commutativity**: The diagram shows that applying the morphisms and then the functors yields the same result as applying the functors and then the corresponding morphisms in the target categories.
- **Why This Representation Ensures Design Requirements**:
  - **Consistency**: Changes in task states are consistently reflected in both the file system and the RDF representations.
  - **Integrity**: By preserving morphisms through functors, we maintain the integrity of task data across different representations.
  - **Scalability**: The model allows for extension without altering the underlying structure.

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3**: For scripts and RDF generation.
- **Bash**: For CLI scripting.
- **RDF Tools**: Such as Apache Jena for advanced RDF handling.

### Phase 1: Task Generation

**Objective**: Implement task creation and initial representation.

#### Task Creation Script (`bin/oa`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

TASK_DIR="data/tasks"
BIN_DIR="$(dirname "$0")"
PROJECT_ROOT="$(dirname "$BIN_DIR")"

generate_task_id() {
    last_id=$(ls $TASK_DIR | grep -Eo 'OA_TASK-[0-9]+' | sort | tail -n 1 | grep -Eo '[0-9]+$')
    next_id=$((last_id + 1))
    printf "OA_TASK-%03d" $next_id
}

create_task() {
    task_id=$(generate_task_id)
    task_file="$TASK_DIR/$task_id.yaml"
    read -r -d '' TASK_YAML <<EOF
task_id: $task_id
summary: "$1"
status: "backlog"
priority: "$2"
requirements: []
linked_tasks: []
description: ""
metadata:
  created_by: "$(whoami)"
  created_at: "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")"
  state_changes:
    - state: "backlog"
      timestamp: "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")"
EOF
    echo "$TASK_YAML" > "$task_file"
    ln -s "../$task_file" "$PROJECT_ROOT/backlog/$task_id.yaml"
    echo "Task $task_id created."
}

# Command parsing
case "$1" in
    task)
        shift
        case "$1" in
            create)
                shift
                create_task "$@"
                ;;
            *)
                echo "Unknown task command."
                ;;
        esac
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: oa task create \"Task Summary\" \"Priority\""
        ;;
esac
```

- **Notes**:
  - **CLI Name**: `oa`
  - **Extensibility**: Can be extended with `oa-task`, `oa-requirement`, etc.
  - **Arguments**: Supports arguments and piping.

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Create a new task
echo "Design the project management subsystem" | oa task create - "high"

# Or directly with arguments
oa task create "Design the project management subsystem" "high"
```

### Phase 2: State Transitions and Morphisms

**Objective**: Implement state transitions as morphisms.

#### State Transition Function (`change_task_state`)

```bash
change_task_state() {
    task_id="$1"
    new_state="$2"
    task_file="data/tasks/$task_id.yaml"

    # Find current state
    current_state=$(find . -type l -name "$task_id.yaml" | xargs dirname | xargs basename)

    # Remove symlink from current state
    rm "$current_state/$task_id.yaml"

    # Add symlink to new state
    ln -s "../$task_file" "$new_state/$task_id.yaml"

    # Update status in task file
    sed -i "s/^status: .*/status: \"$new_state\"/" "$task_file"

    # Append state change to metadata
    sed -i "/state_changes:/a \  - state: \"$new_state\"\n    timestamp: \"$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")\"" "$task_file"
}

# Usage example:
# oa task start OA_TASK-001
```

- **Notes**:
  - **Deletion Morphism**: Removing the symlink effectively "deletes" the task from that state.
  - **Preservation**: Morphisms preserve the structure by accurately reflecting state changes.

### Phase 3: Functors and System Integration

**Objective**: Map morphisms to external systems using functors.

#### Define Functors

```bash
functor_symlink_update() {
    # Already handled in change_task_state
    :
}

functor_rdf_update() {
    task_id="$1"
    ./bin/generate_rdf.sh "$task_id"
}

functor_api_update() {
    # Placeholder for API update logic
    :
}
```

#### Invoke Functors After State Changes

```bash
change_task_state() {
    # Existing state change logic
    # ...

    # Invoke functors
    functor_symlink_update
    functor_rdf_update "$task_id"
    functor_api_update "$task_id"
}
```

- **Preservation of Morphisms**:
  - **Source Category**: Task state transitions.
  - **Target Categories**: File system symlinks, RDF representations.
  - **Functors** ensure that the structure of morphisms (state transitions) is preserved across representations.

### Phase 4: Command-Line Interface (CLI) Development

**Objective**: Develop a user-friendly CLI with flexible commands.

#### Extend `oa` Script with Commands

```bash
# In bin/oa

case "$1" in
    task)
        shift
        case "$1" in
            create)
                shift
                create_task "$@"
                ;;
            start|stop|complete)
                shift
                task_id=$(fuzzy_match_task_id "$1")
                case "$1" in
                    start)
                        change_task_state "$task_id" "active"
                        ;;
                    stop)
                        change_task_state "$task_id" "backlog"
                        ;;
                    complete)
                        change_task_state "$task_id" "completed"
                        ;;
                esac
                ;;
            list)
                shift
                list_tasks "$@"
                ;;
            *)
                echo "Unknown task command."
                ;;
        esac
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: oa task [command] [arguments]"
        ;;
esac
```

#### Implement Fuzzy Matching

```bash
fuzzy_match_task_id() {
    input="$1"
    match=$(ls data/tasks | grep -E "OA_TASK-.*$input.*" | head -n 1)
    echo "${match%.yaml}"
}
```

#### CLI Grammar and Usage

See [Appendix C](#appendix-c-cli-grammar-and-usage) for detailed CLI commands and usage.

### Phase 5: RDF/SPARQL Integration

**Objective**: Represent tasks semantically using RDF and enable querying with SPARQL.

#### Generate RDF Representation (`bin/generate_rdf.sh`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

task_id="$1"
task_file="data/tasks/$task_id.yaml"

python3 bin/generate_rdf.py "$task_file" "data/rdf/$task_id.ttl"
```

#### `generate_rdf.py` Script

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import yaml
import sys
from rdflib import Graph, Namespace, URIRef, Literal
from rdflib.namespace import RDF

task_file = sys.argv[1]
rdf_file = sys.argv[2]
with open(task_file, 'r') as f:
    data = yaml.safe_load(f)

g = Graph()
OA = Namespace("oa:")

task_uri = OA['task/' + data['task_id']]
g.add((task_uri, RDF.type, OA.Task))
g.add((task_uri, OA.summary, Literal(data['summary'])))
g.add((task_uri, OA.status, Literal(data['status'])))
g.add((task_uri, OA.priority, Literal(data['priority'])))

for req in data.get('requirements', []):
    g.add((task_uri, OA.requires, URIRef(req)))
for linked_task in data.get('linked_tasks', []):
    g.add((task_uri, OA.linkedTask, URIRef(linked_task)))

g.add((task_uri, OA.description, Literal(data['description'])))
g.add((task_uri, OA.createdBy, Literal(data['metadata']['created_by'])))
g.add((task_uri, OA.createdAt, Literal(data['metadata']['created_at'])))

for state_change in data['metadata']['state_changes']:
    state_node = URIRef(f"{task_uri}/stateChange/{state_change['timestamp']}")
    g.add((task_uri, OA.stateChange, state_node))
    g.add((state_node, OA.state, Literal(state_change['state'])))
    g.add((state_node, OA.timestamp, Literal(state_change['timestamp'])))

g.serialize(destination=rdf_file, format='turtle')
```

- **Notes**:
  - **Growing the RDF Graph**: Each task and its state changes are added to the RDF graph, allowing it to grow over time.
  - **Visualization**: RDF/Turtle files can be visualized using RDF visualization tools.

### Terminal User Interface (TUI) Representation

For terminal-based interfaces, the TUI can display tasks in multiple modes:

1. **Single-Line Mode**:

   ```plaintext
   OA_TASK-001: Design the project management subsystem | Status: active | Priority: high
   ```

2. **Expanded Block Mode**:

   ```plaintext
   OA_TASK-001
   Summary       : Design the project management subsystem
   Status        : active
   Priority      : high
   Requirements  : oa:requirement:OA_SRS-001
   Linked Tasks  : oa:task/OA_TASK-002
   Description   : This task involves designing and implementing the project management system.
   Metadata      : created_by=user, created_at=2024-10-02T12:00:00Z
   ```

3. **SPARQL Query Mode**:

   Allows users to input SPARQL queries directly within the TUI to filter and display tasks based on semantic data.

    null --------------------> backlog ----------------> active ------------------> completed
     |                          |                         |                          |
     |                          |                         |                          |
     v                          v                         v                          v
    oa:task:null           oa:task:backlog          oa:task:active            oa:task:completed
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **Objects**: Represented by `oa:task:<state>` identifiers.
  - **Morphisms**: State transitions between task objects.
  - **Preservation**: Morphisms in the source category (tasks) are preserved in the target category (RDF) via functors.

```

- **Explanation**:
  - **Functor F** maps each task and morphism to RDF resources and triples.
  - **Preservation**: The structure of morphisms is preserved; state transitions correspond to updates in the RDF graph.

## Conclusion and Future Work

The **Project Management Subsystem** provides a flexible and extensible framework for task management within the **Orchestration Architect**. By utilizing category theory concepts, symlink-based state management, morphisms, functors, and semantic representations, it ensures consistency, scalability, and elegance in system design.

### Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Category-Theoretic Modeling**:
   - Explore duality and axiomatic properties to enable more behaviors and elegant mappings.
   - **Goal**: Simplify complex interactions and improve system robustness.

2. **Advanced RDF/SPARQL Querying**:
   - Implement complex SPARQL queries to filter tasks by metadata, relationships, and semantic context.
   - **Goal**: Enhance querying capabilities for better task management insights.

3. **API Development for OpenAI Function Calling**:
   - Develop an API that provides standardized responses suitable for OpenAI function calling.
   - **Goal**: Facilitate the generation of tasks from poorly formatted inputs.

4. **Integration with Other Collections**:
   - Link tasks with other collections like `oa:collection:orchestration_architect.containers`.
   - **Goal**: Enable broader orchestration across different subsystems.

5. **Composability and Extensibility**:
   - Continue to design components that are composable and extendable.
   - **Goal**: Ensure new features can be added without disrupting existing functionality.

- **General Structure**: `oa:<entity_type>:<identifier>`
- **Entity Types**:
  - `task`: Tasks (e.g., `oa:task:OA_TASK-001`)
  - `requirement`: Requirements (e.g., `oa:requirement:OA_SRS-001`)
  - `collection`: Collections (e.g., `oa:collection:orchestration_architect.containers`)

### Appendix B: RDF Schema Definitions

Define RDF classes and properties for tasks.

**Classes**:

- `oa:Task`

**Properties**:

- `oa:summary`
- `oa:status`
- `oa:priority`
- `oa:requires`
- `oa:linkedTask`
- `oa:description`
- `oa:createdBy`
- `oa:createdAt`
- `oa:stateChange`
- `oa:timestamp`
- `oa:state`

### Appendix C: CLI Grammar and Usage

#### Command Structure

```bash
oa <subsystem> <command> [arguments]
```

#### Subsystems

- `task`: Manage tasks.
- Additional subsystems can be added as `oa-<subsystem>`.

#### Commands for `task`

- `create`: Create a new task.
  - **Usage**: `oa task create "Task Summary" "Priority"`
- `start`: Move task to `active`.
  - **Usage**: `oa task start <TASK_ID>`
- `stop`: Move task back to `backlog`.
  - **Usage**: `oa task stop <TASK_ID>`
- `complete`: Move task to `completed`.
  - **Usage**: `oa task complete <TASK_ID>`
- `list`: List tasks.
  - **Usage**: `oa task list [state]`
- `delete`: Delete task (removes symlink).
  - **Usage**: `oa task delete <TASK_ID>`

#### Examples

```bash
# Create a new task
oa task create "Implement the new feature" "medium"

# Start a task
oa task start OA_TASK-002

# Complete a task
oa task complete OA_TASK-002

# List all active tasks
oa task list active

# Delete a task
oa task delete OA_TASK-003
```
