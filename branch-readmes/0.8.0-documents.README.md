# Orchestration Architect: **Documents** `0.8.0-documents` Branch

This branch contains all the documentation for the **Orchestration Architect** project. It serves as the blueprint for building and understanding the entire system. Each subdirectory represents a documentation subsystem, which **functorially maps** to other branches and concepts within the project. This README is designed to be comprehensive and precise, providing a clear guide for the project's development and the **auto-self-documenting system**.

## 1. Introduction

The **Orchestration Architect** framework focuses on orchestrating systems as composable units, leveraging **category theory** to create a modular, scalable, and self-regenerating architecture. This documentation branch maps the workspace and serves as the central hub for all project documentation, separate from the repository's main README. It is crucial for ensuring that every component of the project is well-documented and that the documentation itself can guide the building of the system.

## 2. Directory Structure Overview

The directory structure is carefully designed to represent documentation subsystems. Each subdirectory corresponds to a subsystem that **functorially maps** to other branches and concepts within the project.

## 3. Documentation Subsystems

Each subdirectory in this branch serves as a **documentation subsystem**, mapping to specific aspects of the project. These subsystems are designed with functorial relationships to other branches and concepts, ensuring a coherent and consistent documentation and development process.

### Project Management

**Directory**: `documents/project/`

Manages tasks and project progress through a symlink-based task system. It includes:

- **README.md**: Explains the task management process, symlink system, and Kanban board generation.
- **kanban**: Python script for generating the Kanban board.
- **tasks/**: Contains task files categorized into `backlog-tasks/`, `active-tasks/`, and `completed-tasks/`.

### System Specifications

**Directory**: `documents/specifications/`

Organizes system specifications into two main categories:

- **system_collections/**: Documents **entities of the infrastructure**, such as system planes.
  - **OA000_System_Bootstrap.md**
  - **OA001_System_Master_Control_Node.md**
  - **OA002_Live_Hypervisor.md**
  - **OA999_Test_Bench.md**
- **configuration_collections/**: Documents **configurable subsystems**.
  - **Meta_Collection.md**
  - **Storage_Collection.md**
  - **Networking_Collection.md**

This separation ensures that system collections (infrastructure entities) and configuration collections (configurable subsystems) are distinctly documented, reflecting their different roles within the project.

### Branch Documentation

**Directory**: `documents/branch-readmes/`

Contains the authoritative README files for each branch. These files are synchronized with the top-level `README.md` of their respective branches, ensuring consistency.

- **0.8.0-documents.README.md**: This file, synchronized to the top level of the repository.
- **Other Branch READMEs**: Document the purpose and structure of other branches.

### Transcripts and Minutes

**Directory**: `documents/transcripts/`

Logs conversations with AI systems and meeting minutes using the **RS transcript format**. This subsystem captures the evolution of ideas and decisions.

- **README.md**: Explains the RS transcript format and directory structure.
- **YYYY-MM-DD.md**: Daily logs of conversations and minutes (e.g., `2024-05-08.md`).

### Designs and Architecture

**Directory**: `documents/designs/`

Contains high-level documents about the system's architecture and Git workflow.

- **Documentation_Structure.md**: Details how the documentation system is organized.
- **Git_Branch_Workflow_System.md**: Explains the Git branching strategy.

### Theoretical Concepts and Applications

**Directory**: `documents/theory/`

Captures the theoretical foundations of the project, focusing on **Category Theory** and **Abstract Compositional Topology (ACT)**.

- **Abstract_Compositional_Topology/**: Contains overviews and detailed discussions on ACT.
- **Category_Theory/**: Explores category theory concepts applicable to the project.

## 4. File Structure Mapping

### Roles and Playbooks

The **Orchestration Architect** uses **Ansible roles and playbooks** to define system behavior. The file structure for roles and playbooks is mapped to the specifications defined in the documentation.

**Roles Directory Structure**:

```plaintext
roles/
├── <role_name>/
│   ├── tasks/
│   │   ├── main.yml
│   │   ├── present.yml
│   │   ├── absent.yml
│   │   └── info.yml
│   ├── vars/
│   │   └── main.yml
│   └── templates/
│       └── <templates_if_any>
```

**Playbooks Directory Structure**:

```plaintext
playbooks/
├── <playbook_collection_name>/
│   ├── <playbook_name>.yml
│   └── vars/
│       └── main.yml
```

These structures are defined in the specifications and are used to generate the actual roles and playbooks that configure the system.

### Specifications Organization

**Specifications** are split to separate configuration from the broader system definitions:

- **Global Specifications**:
  - **roles.yml**
  - **playbooks.yml**
  - **templates.yml**

These files contain the variable definitions that generate the systems and collections but are not themselves part of the collections.

- **Collection-Specific Specifications**:
  - Located under `collections/<collection_name>/vars/`
  - Contains specific configurations for each collection.

#### Considerations:

- **Separation vs. Consolidation**:
  - **Separated Specifications**: Keeping roles, playbooks, and templates specifications in separate files allows for modularity and clarity, especially as the project scales.
  - **Consolidated Specifications**: Placing all specifications into a single collection specification file reduces the number of files to manage but may become unwieldy as complexity grows.

**Decision**:

For the purposes of clarity and maintainability, it's recommended to **maintain separation** of specifications. This allows for easier navigation and updating, especially as the self-assembly bootstrap transitions build up to processing all specifications.

## 5. Automation Script

To model the documents and form the categorical structures for the **meta_document system**, we provide a script that generates the directory structure using `mkdir` and `touch`. This script can be easily updated as the project evolves.

**Script: `generate_document_structure.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create base directories
mkdir -p documents/{project/{tasks/{backlog-tasks,active-tasks,completed-tasks}},specifications/{system_collections,configuration_collections},branch-readmes,transcripts,designs,theory}

# Create README files
touch documents/{project/README.md,specifications/README.md,branch-readmes/README.md,transcripts/README.md,designs/README.md,theory/README.md}

# Create sample files in specifications
touch documents/specifications/system_collections/{OA000_System_Bootstrap.md,OA001_System_Master_Control_Node.md,OA002_Live_Hypervisor.md,OA999_Test_Bench.md}
touch documents/specifications/configuration_collections/{Meta_Collection.md,Storage_Collection.md,Networking_Collection.md}

# Create sample branch readmes
touch documents/branch-readmes/{0.8.0-documents.README.md,0.8.0-dev.README.md,0.8.0-seed.README.md,0.8.0-pristine.README.md,0.8.0-sandbox.README.md,0.8.0-tests.README.md,0.8.0-assets.README.md,0.8.0-tools.README.md,pre-release_splash.README.md}

# Create sample transcripts
touch documents/transcripts/{YYYY-MM-DD.md}

# Create design files
touch documents/designs/{Documentation_Structure.md,Git_Branch_Workflow_System.md}

# Create theory files
mkdir -p documents/theory/{Abstract_Compositional_Topology,Category_Theory}
touch documents/theory/Abstract_Compositional_Topology/Overview.md
touch documents/theory/Category_Theory/Adjunction.md
```

**Usage**:

```bash
chmod +x generate_document_structure.sh
./generate_document_structure.sh
```

## 7. Conclusion

By meticulously organizing this documentation branch and ensuring that each subsystem is well-defined and functorially mapped to the project's codebase, we create a robust foundation for the **Orchestration Architect** framework. This approach not only aids in building and maintaining the system but also facilitates future automation and scalability.

This `0.8.0-documents.README.md` file is synchronized with the top-level `README.md` of the repository to provide a comprehensive overview of the documentation structure and its relationship with the rest of the project.
