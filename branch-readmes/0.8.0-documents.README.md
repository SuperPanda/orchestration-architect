## Project Management

The **project** section manages tasks and project progress through a symlink-based task system. Tasks are organized into **backlog**, **active**, and **completed** states, with a Python-generated **Kanban board** for visualization.

**Directory**: `documents/project/`

- **[README.md](project/README.md)**: Describes the task management process, how tasks are tracked using symlinks, and how the Kanban board is generated.
  
- **kanban**: A Python script that generates the Kanban board based on task states.

- **tasks/**: Contains individual task files (e.g., `OA-META-001.md`), symlinked to state directories.

- **backlog-tasks/**, **active-tasks/**, **completed-tasks/**: These directories house symlinked tasks categorized by their current state.

---

## System Specifications

The **specifications** directory organizes the system into **collections**, each representing different subsystems (e.g., Meta, Storage, Networking). These collections document specific areas of the system and their roles.

**Directory**: `documents/specifications/`

- **[specifications.README.md](/documents/specifications/specifications.README.md)**: Provides an overview of the collection structure and how subsystems are documented.

- **collections/**:
  - **Meta_Collection.md**: Documentation for the Meta Collection, which manages system orchestration and configuration.
  - **Storage_Collection.md**: Documentation for the Storage Collection, which manages volumes, partitions, and filesystems.
  - **Networking_Collection.md**: Documentation for the Networking Collection, which handles network configuration.

## Branch Documentation

The **Branch Documentation** section captures the purpose of each branch within the project. Each branch serves a distinct function in the development lifecycle, from initial bootstrapping to production-ready systems.

The authoritative source for each branch's README is maintained within the `documents/branch-readmes/` directory. Each branch's detailed documentation is stored in a file named `documents/branch-readmes/<versioned_branch_name>.README.md`. These files are either **symlinked** or **synchronized** to the top-level `README.md` of their respective branches to ensure consistency across the documentation structure. For instance, `0.8.0-documents.README.md` is symlinked to the top-level `README.md` of the `documents` branch, allowing for easy updates and a single source of truth for each branch’s documentation.

### Development Branch

- **[0.8.0-dev.README.md](/documents/branch-readmes/0.8.0-dev.README.md)**: Documentation for the **Development branch**, where active development takes place.

### Seed Branch

- **[0.8.0-seed.README.md](/documents/branch-readmes/0.8.0-seed.README.md)**: Documentation for the **Seed branch**, a minimal bootstrapped system used for generating the pristine branch.

### Pristine Branch

- **[0.8.0-pristine.README.md](/documents/branch-readmes/0.8.0-pristine.README.md)**: Documentation for the **Pristine branch**, the production-ready system.

### Sandbox Branch

- **[0.8.0-sandbox.README.md](/documents/branch-readmes/0.8.0-sandbox.README.md)**: Documentation for the **Sandbox branch**, used for isolated testing and prototyping and proof of concepts.

### Testing Branch

- **[0.8.0-tests.README.md](/documents/branch-readmes/0.8.0-tests.README.md)**: Documentation for the **Testing branch**, used for validating changes before they are merged into the main development pipeline.

### Assets Branch

- **[0.8.0-assets.README.md](/documents/branch-readmes/0.8.0-assets.README.md)**: Documentation for the **Assets branch**, which stores media, diagrams, and other project assets.

### Tools Branch

- **[0.8.0-tools.README.md](/documents/branch-readmes/0.8.0-tools.README.md)**: Documentation for the **Tools branch**, which includes scripts and utilities for orchestration and development workflows.

### Pre-Release Splash

- **[pre-release_splash.README.md](/documents/branch-readmes/pre-release_splash.README.md)**: Documentation for the **Pre-Release Splash branch**, covering pre-release information and project previews.

## Conversation Minutes

The **minutes/** directory logs conversations between the **user and GPT** (or other AI systems) using the **RS transcript format**. These logs capture questions, discussions, and ideas, ensuring that key points from development interactions are preserved.

**Directory**: `documents/minutes/`

- **[minutes.README.md](/documents/minutes/minutes.README.md)**: Explains how conversation logs are captured using the **RS transcript format**.

  ### RS Transcript Format:
  ```
  [<timestamp>, speaker=<USER|GPT|other>]
  ␞ This is the message content, capturing the conversation flow.
  ```

- **minutes-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md**: Logs of conversations are stored by date (e.g., `minutes-2024-05-08.md`), capturing the flow of user-AI interactions.

## System Architecture and Git Workflow

This section contains high-level documents about the system's architecture and how the Git branching workflow is designed to support modular development and deployment processes.

**Directory**: `documents/`

- **[architecture.README.md](/documents/architecture.md)**: Documentation of the system architecture, detailing how subsystems (e.g., configuration, storage, networking) interact.

- **designs/**:
  - **[Documentation_Structure.md](/documents/designs/Documentation_Structure.md)**: Documentation outlining how the entire documentation system is structured.
  - **[Git_Branch_Workflow_System.md](/documents/designs/Git_Branch_Workflow_System.md)**: Explanation of how Git branching is used to manage development, including strategies for transitioning between different branches (seed, pristine, dev).

---

## Theoretical Concepts and Applications

The **theory/** section captures the theoretical foundations of the project, focusing on how **category theory** and **Abstract Compositional Topology (ACT)** are applied to system design.

**Directory**: `documents/theory/`

- **[theory.README.md](/documents/theory/theory.README.md)**: Overview of the theoretical frameworks used, such as category theory and how they apply to the project.

- **Abstract_Compositional_Topology/**:
  - **Overview.md**: An introduction to **Abstract Compositional Topology (ACT)**, explaining its role in the project.

- **Category_Theory/**:
  - **Adjunction.md**: Documents the use of adjunctions and other category theory concepts, focusing on how these principles support system consistency and regeneration.

## Task Checklist

Use this task checklist to ensure all the documentation is set up and populated:

- [ ] Write and finalize **project.README.md** for task management.
- [ ] Populate **specifications.README.md** and the collection-specific markdown files.
- [ ] Write the **branch-readmes** for all branches: dev, seed, pristine, sandbox, tests, assets, tools, and pre-release splash.
- [ ] Set up **minutes.README.md** and log conversations with the AI system using the RS transcript format.
- [ ] Complete **architecture.README.md** and designs for system architecture and Git workflow.
- [ ] Build out the **theory** section, focusing on category theory applications and ACT development.
