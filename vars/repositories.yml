            The codebase that reflects the resultant transformation from the seed branch,
            the branch takes the diff between the HEAD of the pristine branch, and the bootstrap environment

            The branch where changed and worked on. Rebased on pristine when it is updated.
            The 'dev' branch is used to generate the next seed state, ensuring that the seed
            is able to undergo the bootstrap process in order to update the pristine branch.
