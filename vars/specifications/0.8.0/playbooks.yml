          A collection of playbooks build, modify and extend Orchestration
          Architect, ensuring that the design of the system is consistent, managable,
          adheres to the underlying design principles and ensures compatability with
          different components and dynamically updating the interactions between components
          when designs change. Manages specifications, migrations, playbooks and roles.

        description: |
          A collection of playbooks to build the portable management node
          of Orchestration Architect. Depends only on ansible and pacman as its dependency.
          If USB not available use a loop device. This collection can provision a LiveUSB
          environment with full disk encryption and persistence, open and mount LiveUSB,
          customize, modify and recover existing installations, and safely prepare device
          for ejection.
          Also allows for rekeying luks and root accounts (requires specification
          of a development luks keyfile or entering luks passphrase). Tested under default
          Arch Linux Installation Live Install media.
