# **Idea Catalogue for Orchestration Architect Project**
## Overview
Below is a structure to organize the major ideas discussed, written in a format that can later be used to generate tasks, requirements, designs, and rationales. This format will help build a detailed catalogue of the ideas, which you can use for generating documentation, implementing the system, and conducting further evaluations.

### 1. **Category Theory in Systems Design**

**Description**:  
This idea focuses on applying category theory to automate system design, using functors and morphisms to manage system changes.

**Tasks**:  
- Define functors for storage, container, and runtime management.
- Model category theory principles in the form of automated system tasks.

**Requirements**:  
- Category theory principles implemented in functorial form.
- Each morphism must ensure system changes without side effects.

**Design**:  
- Functor categories like `runtime` and `storage` map system components to tasks.
- Morphisms represent transitions (e.g., booting a container, modifying storage).
  
**Rationale**:  
Category theory ensures a clean, structured approach to organizing systems. Functor-based system construction allows reproducibility, composability, and maintainability of complex systems.

### 2. **Ephemeral Containers and Ephemeral Storage Pools**

**Description**:  
Ephemeral containers should be sandboxed environments designed for testing and experimentation. Ephemeral storage pools are temporary storage solutions that are non-persistent and reset after each use.

**Tasks**:  
- Implement ephemeral storage configurations in `vars/storage/ephemeral.yml`.
- Set up systemd-nspawn containers for experiments with temporary storage mounted in `/mnt/orchestration_architect/ephemeral`.

**Requirements**:  
- A clear separation between persistent and ephemeral storage.
- Integration with btrfs subvolumes for flexibility in container environments.

**Design**:  
- Loop devices provide storage pools that contain btrfs subvolumes.
- Containers are created within these pools and destroyed after each session.

**Rationale**:  
Ephemeral systems allow rapid iteration without affecting the core environment, which is essential for testing experimental configurations without long-term side effects.

### 3. **Distributed LDAP for Transient Systems**

**Description**:  
This idea explores distributing an LDAP service across transient systems, where each system can provide lightweight directory services in environments like mobile or ad-hoc networks.

**Tasks**:  
- Implement LDAP as a service across distributed systems.
- Use ephemeral containers to instantiate temporary LDAP nodes.

**Requirements**:  
- LDAP nodes must be lightweight and transient, with data synchronized across nodes.
- Ensure that mobile systems can seamlessly access the LDAP services.

**Design**:  
- Each system can serve as a node in the distributed LDAP service.
- Synchronization is done through regular network intervals or direct file transfer if necessary.

**Rationale**:  
A distributed LDAP service helps to maintain consistent access to directory services in environments where systems frequently go offline or change locations.

### 4. **Zero Trust Networking for Secure Systems**

**Description**:  
Zero Trust Networking (ZTN) isolates the systems to prevent lateral movement of attacks, ensuring that systems communicate only on a need-to-know basis and with strict verification.

**Tasks**:  
- Design a private network space for containers and nodes using user namespaces.
- Implement ephemeral systems that use private networking only accessible from localhost.

**Requirements**:  
- All communication should be limited to trusted interfaces.
- Implement identity and access management on a container-by-container basis.

**Design**:  
- Use network namespaces to isolate containers.
- Implement SSH with zero-trust principles and secure enclaves.

**Rationale**:  
Zero Trust Networking ensures that systems stay secure even if they are transient, protecting critical services by limiting access and preventing unauthorized lateral movement.

### 5. **System Provisioning via Containers (Portable systemd-nspawn)**

**Description**:  
System provisioning should be flexible and portable, allowing for parts of the system to run in containers without the need to fully boot every component.

**Tasks**:  
- Use `systemd-nspawn` to create portable containers for specific system tasks.
- Design playbooks that can automatically build and provision these containers.

**Requirements**:  
- Containers must be self-contained, bootable units that are portable between environments.
- Storage pools should be mounted dynamically based on system state.

**Design**:  
- Use ephemeral storage pools to host containers, but provide persistent configuration for easy restoration.
- Containers should be pre-configured with all necessary system components.

**Rationale**:  
Portable containers ensure that only the necessary components of a system are running, reducing the overhead of booting full systems when only isolated tasks are required.

### 6. **Open vSwitch Role Redesign**

**Description**:  
A new Open vSwitch role will be created to replace the deprecated Ansible community role. This role will be designed from the ground up to ensure maximum flexibility.

**Tasks**:  
- Rebuild Open vSwitch role using Ansible's `command` and `shell` modules.
- Ensure compatibility with existing networking configurations.

**Requirements**:  
- Open vSwitch commands should be issued directly with clean, modular tasks.
- Role must integrate with other networking roles and provide clear configuration options.

**Design**:  
- Modular design with clear separation between OVS bridges, ports, and tunnels.
- Commands issued in a way that ensures consistency across reboots and updates.

**Rationale**:  
A custom-built Open vSwitch role is necessary to maintain control over networking configurations, ensuring flexibility and long-term support.

### 7. **SSL and SSH Infrastructure for Distributed Systems**

**Description**:  
Design a self-signed SSL and SSH infrastructure to ensure secure communication between all nodes, even when the systems are mobile and transient.

**Tasks**:  
- Implement a system for generating self-signed SSL certificates for all nodes.
- Ensure SSH keys are distributed and synchronized between systems.

**Requirements**:  
- All communication between systems must be encrypted using SSL and authenticated using SSH.
- Keys and certificates must be automatically distributed between transient systems.

**Design**:  
- Use Ansible roles to manage SSL certificate generation and distribution.
- Implement SSH key distribution through containerized ephemeral environments.

**Rationale**:  
An SSL and SSH infrastructure ensures secure communication between systems even when they are transient, mitigating the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.

### 8. **Dynamic, Ephemeral System Configuration via Julia/RDFS**

**Description**:  
Explore using Julia and RDF/RDFS to create dynamic configuration management where functors and morphisms are used to represent system components and their relationships.

**Tasks**:  
- Build an RDF schema to describe morphisms, functors, and system relations.
- Implement a real-time view of system configuration changes, using Julia to manage the model.

**Requirements**:  
- A dynamic schema must be generated based on the current state of the system.
- Real-time updates should reflect changes in the configuration, showing file modifications and dependency relations.

**Design**:  
- Use Julia to manage system models, with RDF mapping representing the relationships between files, configurations, and tasks.
- Implement real-time file monitoring and model rendering for interactive configuration editing.

**Rationale**:  
A dynamic, interactive system model allows for easier experimentation and debugging, providing an intuitive interface for complex system configurations while leveraging the power of category theory.

### 9. **Entertainment and Secure Infrastructure for Remote Work**

**Description**:  
Set up infrastructure that provides entertainment and secure communication in remote environments with limited or no internet connectivity.

**Tasks**:  
- Create an ad-hoc network at a remote camp with transient system nodes.
- Set up entertainment services, like Jellyfin, in a fully air-gapped environment.

**Requirements**:  
- Must function without internet access while providing secure communication and entertainment.
- Systems must be easily deployable and maintainable on-site.

**Design**:  
- Implement a PXE-bootable hypervisor to create transient virtual machines.
- Use local storage and caching systems to provide multimedia services.

**Rationale**:  
This setup ensures that even in remote environments, systems are functional, secure, and capable of providing essential services without external dependencies.
