okay for my version system, all branches are based on the initial-<x.y.z version> and branch with an empty branch for the initial object for the universal properity. I have seed branch which S[n] where S[n]->S[n+1] is the minimal (limit) of changes such that P[n]->P[n+1] which is the morphism between pristine states, which S[n] becomes a P[n] via the bootstrap process so B: S -> P, and also that the diff D<P[n],B(S[n+1])> patch is exactly the same as P[n]->P[n+1]. Now D the develop branch is a bit different, so for example all the commits to the seed branch are squashed such the S[n]->S[n+1] so S has morphisms in itself but doesn't change. How since everything is initialised for example with init[y] -> dev[y], init[y] -> pristine[y], and init[y] seed[y], and S[y] -> P[y] -> D[y]. But if Dev makes a change and the D[y] if the same files used to supply D[y] -> S[y'] via copying the minimal files, if the S[y'] is homomorphic to B[S[y]] then P[y']

It sounds like you are describing a complex versioning and branching system for software development, where you have multiple initial states and branches that track different types of changes in a structured manner. To clarify your system, let's try to break it down into more manageable parts:

1. **Branches and States**:
   - **Initial Branch (`init`)**: The starting point for other branches.
   - **Seed Branch (`S[n]`)**: Represents a sequence of minimal changes, with each step being represented as `S[n] -> S[n+1]`.
   - **Pristine Branch (`P[n]`)**: Derived from Seed, representing a state after bootstrapping, with `P[n] = B(S[n])`.
   - **Development Branch (`D[y]`)**: Used for active development changes that eventually influence `S[y']`.

2. **Properties and Processes**:
   - **Bootstrap Process (`B`)**: A transformation from Seed to Pristine, `B: S -> P`.
   - **Differences/Patches (`D`)**: The diff or patch representing changes between Pristine versions or between Derived and Seed-derived versions.
   - **Morphisms (`P[n] -> P[n+1]`)**: represent transitions between pristine states mimicking the minimal changes in the seed.

3. **Branch Relationships and Operations**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `init[y] -> dev[y]`
     - `init[y] -> pristine[y]`
     - `init[y] -> seed[y]`
   - **Seed to Pristine**:
     - `S[y] -> P[y]`
   - **Pristine to Development (`D`)**:
     - You maintain that `S` changes minimally and consistently; however, commits to Seed are squashed into minimal morphisms.

4. **Development to Seed**:
   - Changes in the Development branch (`D[y]`) should propagate back to Seed (`S[y']`) via copying minimal files or changes to avoid B: S -> P functor having a unique mapping as the P[n] -> P[n'] morphism needs to not be the same as P[n] -> P[n] as it I feel it will lose universal properties required for adjunction, so it needs a new version as the structure of S[n] -> S[n'] because there must be change to align the structure of the functors, and as long as the language (specifications and schema) are still compatible, will will increment the z part. Or it could just be added to . 
   It doesn't have to be minimal, the n can be regenerated/repartition and sorted
